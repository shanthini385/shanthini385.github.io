        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>After earning my Bachelor's in 2018, I kicked off my career as a Linux Systems Admin at the National University of Singapore. Then I switched gears to become a DevOps Engineer at Dell Technologies before landing at UT Austin. Once I graduate, I'm eyeing fields like Cloud or MLOps. Family-wise, we're tight-knit with my parents and elder sister. I've always had a special bond with my grandparents, especially my maternal granddad who served in the police force. His stories are something I always look forward to whenever I visit him. Being born in Singapore, I spent my childhood and schooling there. Later, I moved to Chennai, India for my secondary education and undergrad. After six years of working in Singapore, I've evenly split my 28 years between Singapore and India. My maternal roots are in Chennai, India, and my paternal side is in Singapore. I feel equally connected to both places. Looking ahead, I hope to spend the next 14 years exploring life in the US... just kidding! I always believe going with flow and eventually finding myself in a good place.</p>
